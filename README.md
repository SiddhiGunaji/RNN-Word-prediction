The link for the GloVe data: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 

The following steps were followed:

Step 1: Importing important libraries used in this project.

Step 2: Importing the data from The Project Gutenberg EBook of 'A Short History of the World, by H. G. Wells' and preparing the data.

Step 3: Creating Sliding window of size 20 and spliting the data into training and testing data.

Step 4: Using GloVe data to predict the subsequent data of the training dataset.

Step 5: Building a simple RNN model

Step 6: Compiling and fitting the model.

Step 7: Using the model developed in the previous step, predict the next ten words.
